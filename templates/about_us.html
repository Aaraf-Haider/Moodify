<P style=" font-family: sans-serif">
    Welcome to <b style= "color: rgb(92, 122, 50)">Moodify</b>, a music recommendation platform designed to match your mood with the perfect songs.
    
    I am <b style= "color: rgb(92, 122, 50)">Aaraf Haider</b>, a passionate computer science student currently in my 3rd year at UBIT. My love for music and technology inspired me to create this platform, where users can explore music based on their emotions. By leveraging Flask, SQLite, and machine learning-based song classification, I aim to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for music lovers.
    
    This project is a reflection of my journey in software development, database management, and web technologies. I believe that music has the power to uplift, calm, and energize, and my goal is to help users discover the perfect tunes effortlessly.
    
Thank you for visiting Moodifyâ€”let's find your perfect vibe!
